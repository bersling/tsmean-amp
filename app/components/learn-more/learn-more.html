        Dear Devs: <b>You can help UkraineğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦.</b> I opted for (a) this message and (b) a <a
            href="https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-geo">geo targeted message</a> to Russians
        coming to this page. If you have a blog, you could do something similar, or you can link to a donations page.
        If you don't have one, you could think about launching a page with uncensored news and spread it on Russian
        forums or even Google Review. Or hack some
        russian servers. Get creative.

        Dear russiansğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º. I am a peace loving person from SwitzerlandğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­. It is without a doubt in my mind, that your
        president, Vladimir Putin, has started a war that causes death and suffering for UkrainiansğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦ and
        RussiansğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º.
        Your media is full of lies. Lies about the casualties, about the intentions, about the "Nazi Regime" in Ukraine.
        Please help to mobilize your people against your leader. I know
        it's dangerous for you, but it must be done!
