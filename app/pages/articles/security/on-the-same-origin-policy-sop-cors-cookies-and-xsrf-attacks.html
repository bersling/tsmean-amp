    There are a few things you need to understand why there is this pesky thing called CORS that you need to set up, if
    you want to make a request from the frontend of page <code class="app-code">b.com</code> to a server at <code
    class="app-code">a.com</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what's preventing you from sending those requests is the <b>Same-Origin-Policy (SOP)</b>. It states that if a
    website <code class="app-code">b.com</code> tries to fire a (certain type of) request to a page <code
    class="app-code">a.com</code>, the browser shouldn't even send that request. But why is the browser blocking it, and
    how are you supposed to make your cross origin API calls now?!
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, what's interesting is that the Same-Origin-Policy is something that's only a thing for browsers. When
    you're firing a cURL request, there's no such thing. So you think, hm, but how does the Same-Origin-Policy protect
    my servers if someone can just fire requests against them with cURL anyways?
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, the Same-Origin-Policy is not there to protect your servers, or at least not directly. It's there to protect
    the users of your website, or more broadly speaking the average Joe browsing the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    So how is average Joe being protected by the Same-Origin-Policy?
  </p>
  <p>
    The Same-Origin-Policy mitigates an attack known as Cross-Site-Request-Forgery (XSRF, CSRF).
  </p>
  <h2>On XSRF Attacks</h2>
  <p>
    To understand how XSRF attacks work, we first have to understand one other thing: How cookies are working.
    So let's say you're on <code class="app-code">a.com</code> and log in. Then <code class="app-code">a.com</code>
    returns a cookie which is then stored in your browser such that you don't have to enter your login details again
    when you visit the page again. This cookie could say for example <code class="app-code">user=john;token=abc</code>.
    The browser then <b>attaches this cookie to every subsequent request that is sent to <code
    class="app-code">a.com</code></b>. And it does this (or at least used to do this) for all requests, coming from all
    tabs of your browser, for any website you have open. So if <code class="app-code">b.com</code> then makes a request
    to <code class="app-code">a.com</code> through javascript, the browser will attach the cookie! The server at <code
    class="app-code">a.com</code> then receives a request from a <b>fully authenticated user</b>. Such a request could
    look like so:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-plaintext">POST a.com/do-something
cookies: [user=john,token=abc]</code></pre>
  <p>
    The server at <code class="app-code">a.com</code> then actually proceeds and does what the code behind <code
    class="app-code">do-something</code> is supposed to do for a fully authenticated user. This could be anything: Get
    user data, send emails, transfer money. So in this scenario all an attacker has to do is the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Set up a site <code class="app-code">b.com</code></li>
    <li>Send a behind-the-scenes-request to <code class="app-code">a.com/do-something</code> for everyone that visits
      the page
    </li>
    <li>Lure some people to <code class="app-code">b.com</code>. That's easier that it sounds, think about it, do you
      carefully evaluate every link you click? There's just too many link clicks in our everyday life, so nobody does
      that.
    </li>
    <li>Hope some of the people that land on the page <code class="app-code">b.com</code> are authenticated at <code
      class="app-code">a.com</code></li>
    <li>Let the browser do the rest, because the browser will then execute the javascript and send the request to <code
      class="app-code">a.com</code> <b>and attach the cookies automatically</b>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    So why do we still browse the web with relative carelessness and trust? If every link is such a potential high risk
    threat to all places where we're logged in? That's because most pages we trust and have accounts at (google,
    facebook, our bank) and browsers themselves have implemented measures to prevent those XSRF attacks from happening,
    so it's unlikely that severe damage is caused just by opening <code class="app-code">evilsite.com</code>. What
    exactly are those measures?
  </p>
  <h2>Measure 1: The Same-Origin-Policy</h2>
  <p>
    The Same-Origin-Policy says that only <code class="app-code">a.com</code> may send (a certain kind of) requests to
    <code class="app-code">a.com</code>. If the browser isn't allowed to send requests from <code
    class="app-code">b.com</code> to <code class="app-code">a.com</code>, then your problem is solved. The whole
    workflow above isn't working anymore! So the SOP is a very effective measure to prevent XSRF attacks from happening.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, the SOP isn't as strict, it doesn't block <i>all</i> requests. Only a category of requests. For example
    simple GET requests aren't guarded by it, so it's a bad idea to have your GET endpoints have state altering side
    effects (apart from other reasons). This exception makes a lot of sense, since otherwise you couldn't for example
    use an image like this in <code class="app-code">b.com</code> anymore: &lt;img src="a.com"&gt;. But there are also
    some POST requests allowed. Those must adhere to some strict limitations, for example only the following content
    types are allowed: <code class="app-code">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, <code class="app-code">multipart/form-data</code>,
    <code class="app-code">text/plain</code>. But <b>if</b> <code class="app-code">b.com</code> adheres to those
    limitations <b>and</b> <code class="app-code">a.com</code> <b>offers a corresponding endpoint</b> (accepting a POST
    with <code class="app-code">Content-Type: text/plain</code> for example), then an XSRF attack is still possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    So the website <code class="app-code">a.com</code> can either not offer such an endpoint or, if that's not possible,
    use one of the following measures. But let's first investigate the opposite case: What if the SOP is restricting you
    from making a call from <code class="app-code">myapi.com</code> to <code class="app-code">myfrontend.com</code>, but
    you actually own both domains and the SOP is just getting in your way of making requests?
  </p>
  <h3>
    Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS)
  </h3>
  <p>
    The first time you might have heard of the same origin policy was maybe when you ran into a problem. Namely when you
    tried the exact thing the SOP tries to prevent: Firing a request from <code class="app-code">b.com</code> to <code
    class="app-code">a.com</code>. We nowadays often have this scenario: the backend or at least part of it runs under a
    different domain than the frontend of the page. Still, you'll have to send those requests somehow. That's where
    Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) comes into play.
  </p>
  <p>
    CORS lets the server inform the browser where a request is allowed to come from. While under the Same-Origin-Policy
    the browser wouldn't allow any request (of a certain kind) from another origin, this allows the server to tell the
    browser: "Hey look, I actually know <b>b.com</b>, he's a good friend of mine. I trust him". This is happening in a
    so-called "preflight request". The browser doesn't send the POST (or PUT or DELETE) request immediately, it first
    sends an OPTIONS request that asks "is it okay if I send you a POST request from <code class="app-code">b.com</code>"?
    Then the server may respond with "Yeah sure, I trust that guy" (1), or "heck no, I don't know who that is!" (2) or
    "uhm I don't care where a request comes from" (3).
  </p>
  <p>
    To achieve (1), the server has to allow-list the origin <code class="app-code">b.com</code> in the response of the
    preflight request in an <code class="app-code">Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://b.com</code> header. To achieve
    (2) the server actually doesn't have to do anything, that's the standard behaviour, to block cross-origin-requests.
    The third option is possible by either returning a wildcard <code class="app-code">Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
    *</code> or by checking where the request is coming from and then just putting that origin in the <code
    class="app-code">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header no matter what it is. But unless you're building a public
    API that should be accessible directly from the browser as well, you should only relax the SOP through CORS as
    little as required, by whitelisting your known frontend-domains.
  </p>
  <h2>Measure 2: Same-Site Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    Remember how I told you that cookies are sent along on every request? Well this was not 100% accurate. While it
    might have started out that way, today this isn't the case anymore. There's now an attribute for cookies that helps
    servers to determine when cookies should get attached to requests. For example, if you have a backend and a frontend
    that are on the same domain and you know that's the only usecase you have, then you can set <code class="app-code">SameSite=strict</code>.
    This will then tell the browser to <b>not</b> attach the cookie to a request when it's coming from another origin.
    So a cross origin request from <code class="app-code">b.com</code> to <code class="app-code">a.com</code> would
    still get sent, but it wouldn't have the cookie attached. This (respectively <code
    class="app-code">SameSite=Lax</code>, a similar setting) is now the default for all modern browsers.
    One thing to keep in mind with <code class="app-code">"SameSite=Lax"</code> is, that it still allows GET requests.
    So, badly
    designed API endpoints, that allow actions with GET requests, are still vulnerable.
  </p>
  <h2>Measure 3: XSRF tokens</h2>
  <p>
    In addition to other measures, the server sometimes issues a one-time-token to requests it expects. This means a
    cookie isn't enough anymore for the server to perceive a request as fully authenticated. In addition the server also
    expects that the client knows this one-time token. So if you go to <code class="app-code">b.com</code> and a request
    to transfer your money is sent to <code class="app-code">a.com</code>, the server at <code
    class="app-code">a.com</code> will reject the request programmatically even though there's a cookie present because
    the token is missing. The implementation of such XSRF-token workflows is most often done by frameworks, such as
    Spring Security for Java or the Django framework for python.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the previous two measures (SOP and Same-Site Cookies) mostly put the burden of implementation on <b>browser
    vendors</b>, XSRF tokens need to be implemented by web developers.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Summary: What do I need to know as a web developer?
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      XSRF used to be a very prevalent attack, because cookies <b>from</b> <code class="app-code">a.com</code> were
      attached to <b>every</b> request <b>to</b> <code class="app-code">a.com</code>, even to those requests originating
      from <code class="app-code">b.com</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Same-Origin-Policy deals with this by simply not allowing (certain) requests other than to the page you're
      currently on. So you can't send (certain) requests from <code class="app-code">b.com</code> to <code
      class="app-code">a.com</code>. Of course sometimes you're not evil, but still want to be able to send cross site
      requests. That's where CORS comes into play.
    </li>
    <li>
      Another layer of security is the cookie attribute <code class="app-code">SameSite</code>, which instructs the
      browser not to attach cookies to requests originating from another origin.
    </li>
    <li>
      Another measure to prevent XSRF attacks are one time tokens (XSRF tokens).
    </li>
  </ul>
