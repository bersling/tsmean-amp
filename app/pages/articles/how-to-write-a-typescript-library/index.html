      Writing modular code is a good idea. And nothing is more modular than writing a library.
      How can you write a TypeScript library? Well, that's exactly what this tutorial is about!
      This tutorial works with <b>Typescript 5.x</b>, <b>TypeScript 4.x</b>, <b>TypeScript 3.x</b> and <b>TypeScript 2.x</b>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      <span class="step">Step 1</span>: Setup tsconfig.json
    </h2>
    <p>
      Create a project folder, in this tutorial we'll call it <code class="app-code">typescript-library</code>.
      Then proceed to create a <code class="app-code">tsconfig.json</code> in
      <code class="app-code">typescript-library</code>.
      Your <code class="app-code">tsconfig.json</code> file should look somewhat like this:
    </p>
    <div class="file-label">typescript-library/tsconfig.json</div>
    <pre><code class="language-json">{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es2019",
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*"
  ]
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      Pretty much like a setup for a non-library project, but with one important addition:
      You need to add the <code class="app-code">"declaration": true</code> flag. This will generate the <code class="app-code">.d.ts</code> files (aka declaration files) which contain the types of your code. This way, if someone is using your library and they also use TypeScript, they get the benefits of typesafety and autocomplete!
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the other options, let's quickly go through those: The <a class="app-link" href="/articles/learn-typescript/typescript-module-compiler-option/">module compiler option</a> <code class="app-code">"module": "commonjs"</code> is required if you want your code to run seamlessly with most current node.js applications. Replace this with <code class="app-code">"module": "esnext"</code> if you're building a library for the browser. <code class="app-code">"target": "es2015"</code> specifies which version of JavaScript your code will get transpiled to. This needs to be aligned with the oldest version of node.js (or the oldest browser) you want to support. Choosing es2019 as the compile target makes your library compatible with node.js version 12 and upwards. In 2023, this is a good compromise of transpiling to a modern-ish javascript version (which in turn allows for better performance, more terse code, etc.) and still supporting older nodejs and browser versions. If you have a specific reason to go higher (more cutting-edge native JS features needed in the generated files) or lower (stronger backwards compatibility), you may of course change the version. Lastly, <code class="app-code">"outDir": "./dist"</code> will write your compiled files into the dist folder and the <code class="app-code">include</code> option specifies where your source code lives.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      <span class="step">Step 2</span>: Implement your library
    </h2>
    <p>
      Proceed in the same way, as if you weren't writing a library. Create a <code class="app-code">src</code> folder
      and put all the source files of your library (application logic, data, and assets) there.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this demo, we'll setup a silly <code class="app-code">hello-world.ts</code> file, that looks like so:
    </p>
    <div class="file-label">typescript-library/src/hello-world.ts</div>
    <pre><code class="language-ts">export function sayHello() {
  console.log('hi')
}
export function sayGoodbye() {
  console.log('goodbye')
}
</code></pre>
    
    <h2>
      <span class="step">Step 3</span>: Create an index.ts file
    </h2>
    <p>
      Add an <code class="app-code">index.ts</code> file to your <code class="app-code">src</code> folder.
      Its purpose is to export all the parts of the library you want to make available for consumers.
      In our case it would simply be:
    </p>
    <div class="file-label">typescript-library/src/index.ts</div>
    <pre><code class="language-ts">export {sayHello, sayGoodbye} from './hello-world'</code></pre>
    <p>
      The consumer would be able to use the library later on like so:
    </p>
    <div class="file-label">someotherproject/src/somefile.ts</div>
    <pre><code class="language-ts">import {sayHello} from '<span class="highlight">hwrld</span>'
sayHello();
</code></pre>
    <p>
      You see that we have a new name here, "hwrld",
      we haven't seen anywhere yet.
      What is this name?
      It's the name of the library you're gonna publish to npm also known as the package name!
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      <span class="step">Step 4</span>: Configure the package.json
    </h2>
    <p>
      The package name is what the consumer is going to use to import functionality from your library later on. For this
      demo I have have chosen <code class="app-code">hwrld</code> since it was still available on npm. The package name
      is usually right at the top of the <code class="app-code">package.json</code>. The whole <code class="app-code">package.json</code>
      would look like so:
    </p>
    <div class="file-label">typescript-library/package.json</div>
    <pre><code class="language-json">{
  "name": "hwrld",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Can log \"hello world\" and \"goodbye world\" to the console!",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "files": [
    "/dist"
  ]
}
</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you don't have a package yet you can create one with <code class="app-code">npm init</code> and it will guide
      you through the process.
      Remember, the package name you choose will be used by people for their imports, so choose wisely!
    </p>
    <p>
      There's also one all-important flag in this package.json: You
      have to declare where to find the type declarations!
      This is done using
      <code class="app-code">"types": "dist/index.d.ts"</code>
      Otherwise the consumer won't find your module!
    </p>
    <p>
      The final property <code class="app-code">files</code> helps you to <b>whitelist</b> the files you want to ship to the npm registry. This is usually a
      <a href="https://medium.com/@jdxcode/for-the-love-of-god-dont-use-npmignore-f93c08909d8d">much easier and safer route than using the .npmignore file</a>!
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      <span class="step">Step 5</span>: Publish to npm
    </h2>
    <p>
      To publish your first version to npm run:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">tsc
npm publish
</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you have a scoped package, for example <code class="app-code">@myscope/mypackage</code>, then you need to run
      <code class="app-code">npm publish --access=public</code>, since the default setting is private and for this you need a paid account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you're all set to go! Consume your library anywhere you want by running:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save hwrld</code></pre>
    <p>
      and consume it using
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-ts">import {sayHello} from 'hwrld'
sayHello();</code></pre>
    <p>
      For subsequent releases, use the semver principle. When you make a patch / bugfix to your library, you can run
      <code class="app-code">npm version patch</code>,
      for new features run <code class="app-code">npm version minor</code> and on breaking changes of your api run
      <code class="app-code">npm version major</code>.
    </p>

      The above tutorial contains all the steps necessary to build & publish a working library.
      However, you should probably also include some unit tests and you might want to test the behavior of your library
      locally first, without publishing.
